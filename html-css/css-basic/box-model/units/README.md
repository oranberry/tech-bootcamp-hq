## CSS Units

The values in all of the CSS properties we're learning can be set using different units, such as pixels, percentages, and even centimeters. These can be broadly divided into two groups: absolute units and relative units

- Absolute Units
- Relative Units
  - Percentage: always relative to some other value
  - Font size: REM(Percentage of the body fonts size), EM(Percentage of the parent container font size)
