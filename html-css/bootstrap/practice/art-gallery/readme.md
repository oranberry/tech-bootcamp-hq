# CSS Margin and Padding
The difference between CSS margin and padding may seem confusing at first. Let's do some practice that will help us differentiate the two. 

Your local, online conceptual art museum's digital gallery needs some help!

There are two problems:

1. The picture frames are too close together.
2. There isn't any space between the pictures and the frames they are inside of.

Luckily, you know about the CSS `margin` and `padding` properties.

## Instructions
Start by adding a margin of 25px to the `.picture-frame` rule. Click run and check the preview window. Notice that when we add a margin, space is added _between each picture frame_.

Next, add padding of 25px to the `.picture-frame` rule. Click run and check the preview window. Adding padding creates space _between the picture inside of the frame and the frame itself._

You can think of `margin` as the space around a box and you can think of `padding` as the space between a box and its contents. Great work!
