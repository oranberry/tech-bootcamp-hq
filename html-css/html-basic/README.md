## HTML Basic

- HTML code is made up of HTML elements.
- Each HTML element includes a start tag, the content itself, and a close tag
- Some tags are void or self-closing tags, meaning they don't need a close tag
- Attributes can be added to HTML tags; attributes add additional information
- An attribute is always specified in the start tag
- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs that look like this: name="value"
