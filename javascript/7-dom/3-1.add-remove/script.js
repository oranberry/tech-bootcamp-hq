// We can use JavaScript to grab almost any HTML element

// Edit CSS Properties
// Change color
// Change background
// Size
// Transform

// Don't do that very often 
// Why? A place for everyting... everything has its place
// Structure in HTML
// Style in CSS
// Use JavaScript for interactivity
// Editing styles in JavaScript is a lot like what CSS is suppose to do
// We want to leave a lot of that in CSS

// What we are doing from Javascipt
// Adding classes
// Removing classes
// Define how we want things to look and change in CSS
// Use JavaScipt to apply those classes (categories)
// CSS can implement those change based on the classes we add or remove from an element
