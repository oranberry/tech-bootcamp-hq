## Arrays

---

**Arrays** are data objects that collect multiple values into an ordered list.

In JavaScript, we call varaibles and values, primitive types. And anything that's not a primitive type is called an object. Objects are basically containers that can include named values such as properties or methods.

The most common object you'll use in JavaScript, an array.

Arrays represent a list of items as a single variable.  
`var shoppingList = {"bread", "milk", "cheese", "noodles"};`  
`console.log(shoppingList[0]);` -> bread  
`console.log(shippingLisg[1000]);` -> return undefined
